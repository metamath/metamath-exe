# diff to Doxyfile 1.8.17 with only default settings.

# The Doxyfile reflects your personal documentation style.  It is therefore not
# automatically overwritten by git.  Instead a Doxyfile.diff suggests values we
# think are quite usable.  You can use this file directly by renaming it to
# Doxyfile.  You can prepend its contents to your personal Doxyfile, so that the
# suggested values do not overwrite your settings.  Or, of course, patch your
# file with a subset suiting your needs.

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
