# diff to Doxyfile 1.8.17 with only default settings.

# The Doxyfile reflects your personal documentation style.  It is therefore not
# automatically overwritten by git.  Instead a Doxyfile.diff suggests values we
# think are quite usable.  You can use this file directly by renaming it to
# Doxyfile.  You can prepend its contents to your personal Doxyfile, so that the
# suggested values do not overwrite your settings.  Or, of course, patch your
# file with a subset suiting your needs.

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: YES.

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_STATIC            = YES

# cope with function like macros (pntrString_def and similar).
# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES, doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO, only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting
# EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES
