  cat >&2 << "HELP"
Usage: run_test [-c CMD] [--bless] TESTS...
Run tests from the test suite.

Each TEST should be the name of a TEST.in file in the current directory.
It calls 'metamath TEST.mm < TEST.in > TEST.produced' and compares
TEST.produced with TEST.expected, printing a test failure report.

If TEST.mm does not exist, then it just calls metamath without arguments.

The 'metamath' command can be modified by setting the METAMATH environment
variable, or via the '-c CMD' option (which takes priority).

The --bless option can be used to update the TEST.expected file to match
TEST.produced. Always review the changes after a call to run_test --bless.

TEST.in files have the syntax of metamath scripts, so leading ! can be used to
write comments. This script contains some special directives in tests:

* '! run_test' means that the output will be ignored: TEST.produced will not be
  created and TEST.expected does not have to exist.
* '! expect_fail' means that we expect metamath to return exit code 1
  instead of 0 on this input.
