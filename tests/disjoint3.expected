?Error on line 10 of file "disjoint3.mm" at statement 9, label "bad", type
"$p":
  xf yf ax-1 $.
        ^^^^
There is a disjoint variable ($d) violation at proof step 3.  Assertion "ax-1"
requires that variables "x" and "y" be disjoint.  But "x" was substituted with
"x" and "y" was substituted with "y".
Variables "x" and "y" do not have a disjoint variable requirement in the
assertion being proved, "bad".

All proofs in the database were verified.
