$( Here we have two variable typecodes A and B, and one logical
   typecode |-, and the question is whether |- connects to A or B.
   It parses either way. This is actually an unambiguous formal system,
   because we require only that there are no two ways to derive the proof
   of the *same* syntax theorem, and "A *" and "B *" are different theorems. $)
