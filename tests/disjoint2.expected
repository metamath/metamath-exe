There is a disjoint variable ($d) violation at proof step 7.  Assertion "ax-1"
requires that variables "x" and "y" be disjoint.  But "x" was substituted with
"( x y )" and "y" was substituted with "( z x )".
Variables "x" and "z" do not have a disjoint variable requirement in the
assertion being proved, "verybad".
