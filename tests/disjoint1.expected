?Error on line 10 of file "disjoint1.mm" at statement 9, label "bad", type
"$p":
  xf xf ax-1 $.
        ^^^^
There is a disjoint variable ($d) violation at proof step 3.  Assertion "ax-1"
requires that variables "x" and "y" be disjoint.  But "x" was substituted with
"x" and "y" was substituted with "x".  These substitutions have variable "x" in
common.

All proofs in the database were verified.
