======================   Refactor log   ======================

Protocol of the changes applied to the executable 'metamath'.  Each change
should correspond to a small set of commits implementing this change, and
nothing else (apart from cosmetic corrections).

[wl c6a76d9] Comment update: Better explain the design principles of the fatal
   error handler in the 'Rationale' section.
[wl 322468e] Doxygen: mark which parameters are constant, and which may be
   updated.  Common order of parameters, return and pre-/postconditions.  A few
   improvements in comment texts.
[wl 6e6ec17] The __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros define a source code location,
   which, for example, causes an error.  This is a very standard way to mark a
   position.  The problem is: during development these locations may vary
   because of code insertions or deletions.  So this form of report is not
   stable across program versions, and may cause confusion.  Metamath used #nn
   markers instead, that can be easily found per text search, and do not have
   this drawback.  Discontinue support of this kind of location markers.
[wl 7209823] bug() has an error exit, that was overseen.  Using fatalErrorExit
   also cures a very rare bug: The returned value 1 need not necessarily
   indicate a failure, and can definitly be different from EXIT_FAILURE.
