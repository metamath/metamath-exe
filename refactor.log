======================   Refactor log   ======================

Protocol of the changes applied to the executable 'metamath'.  Each change
should correspond to a small set of commits implementing this change, and
nothing else (apart from cosmetic corrections).

[wl c6a76d9] Comment update: Better explain the design principles of the fatal
   error handler in the 'Rationale' section.
[wl 322468e] Doxygen: mark which parameters are constant, and which may be
   updated.  Common order of parameters, return and pre-/postconditions.  A few
   improvements in comment texts.
[] The __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros define a source code location, which, for
   example, causes an error.  This is a very standard way to mark a position.
   The problem is: during development these locations may vary because of code
   insertion or deletion.  So this form of report is not stable across program
   versions, and may cause confusion.  Metamath used #nn markers instead, that
   can be easily found per text search, and do not have this drawback.
   Discontinue support of this kind of location marks in mmfatl.
