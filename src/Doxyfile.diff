# diff to Doxyfile 1.8.17 with only default settings.

# The Doxyfile reflects your personal documentation style.  It is therefore not
# automatically overwritten by git.  Instead a Doxyfile.diff suggests values we
# think are quite usable.  You can use this file directly by renaming it to
# Doxyfile.  You can append its contents to your personal Doxyfile, so that the
# suggested values overwrite your settings, but leave the rest intact.  Or, of
# course, patch your file with a subset suiting your needs. 

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "metamath executable"

# Set to Metamath version

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "executable used to maintain *.mm files" 

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = "Metamath.png"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = "../doxy"

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: YES.

HAVE_DOT               = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
