 * \fn flag print2(const char* fmt,...)
 * \brief formatted output of a single line with optional page-wise display.
 *
 * It is important to understand that the submitted parameters result in a
 * NUL-terminated string that contains at most one LF character, only allowed
 * in final position.  A long line exceeding \ref g_screenWidth is broken down
 * into multiple lines using a built-in line wrap algorithm.  But this must
 * never be preempted by preparing parameters accordingly.
 *
 * The presence of the LF character in a line shorter than \ref g_screenWidth
 * controls whether the current screen line is closed after print, or output in
 * a later call to print2 is padded right.  Output of more characters than this
 * limit always closes the screen line.
 *
 * Although the output of a single line is the main goal of this function, it
 * does a lot on the side, each effect individually enabled or disabled by
 * various global variables that are honored, sometimes even updated.  We skim
 * through these effects here in short:
 *
 * - (a) __Data embedding__.  The \p fmt parameter can contain simple text,
 *   that is displayed as is.  Or embedded placeholders are replaced with data
 *   pointed to by the following parameters.  If necessary, data are converted
 *   to strings before insertion.
 * - (b) Supporting __page-wise display__.  Output on the virtual text display
 *   is stopped after showing \ref g_screenHeight lines, called a __page__
 *   here.  The user can read the text at rest, and then request resuming
 *   output with a short command.  In fact, this feature is enhanced by
 *   maintaining a \ref pgBackBuffer, allowing the user to recall previously
 *   shown pages, and navigate them freely forward and backwards.  This feature
 *   temporarily grabs user input and interprets short commands as navigating
 *   instructions.  For more see \ref pgBackBuffer.
 * - (c) __Line wrapping__.  When the line to display exceeds the limits in
 *   \ref g_screenWidth, line breaking is applied.  The wrapping is actually
 *   done in \ref printLongLine which in turn uses separate print2 calls to
 *   output each individual line.  This requires a minimum synchronization of
 *   both the outer and inner calls, so that relevant state is carried back to
 *   the outer, temporarily suspended call.
 * - (d) __Redirection__.  Instead of displaying output on the virtual text
 *   display, it may be stored in a NUL-terminated string variable.  Or even
 *   completely suppressed, for example when executing a SUBMIT.
 * - (e) __Logging__.  Output may be logged to a file for examination.
 *
 * These effects need not be carried out in this order, some may even be
 * omitted.  We show the order of steps and their respective conditions here.
 *
 * 1. The \ref backBuffer is almost private to this function, so its
 *     initialization is done here, right at the beginning.  The
 *     \ref backBufferPos is always at least 1, so a value of 0 indicates an
 *     outstanding \ref backBuffer memory allocation, and an empty string is
 *     pushed as a first (guard) page onto it (see \ref pgBackBuffer).
 *
 *     \ref g_pntrTempAllocStackTop may be reset to
 *     \ref g_pntrStartTempAllocStack.
 *
 * 2. If the current page is full and further output would overflow it, as
 *     indicated by \ref printedLines, output may be suspended as described in
 *     (b) and the user is prompted for scrolling actions.\n
 *     This step is unconditionally executed when \ref backFromCmdInput = 1
 *     (\ref cmdInput explicitly requested it).  The values in
 *     \ref g_quitPrint and \ref localScrollMode are retained then, regardless
 *     of user input.
 *
 *     Other conditions prevent this step:  Output is discarded on user request
 *     (\ref g_quitPrint = 1), a SUBMIT call is running
 *     (\ref g_commandFileNestingLevel > 0), scrolling is generally
 *     (\ref g_scrollMode = 0) or temporarily (\ref localScrollMode = 0)
 *     disabled, output is redirected (\ref g_outputToString = 1).
 *
 *     This step can set \ref g_quitPrint to 1 (if \ref backFromCmdInput = 0).
 *     It can modify \ref backBufferPos (by command _q_ or _Q_) and set
 *     \ref localScrollMode = 0 (by command _s_ or _S_, and
 *     \ref backFromCmdInput = 0).
 *
 * 3. If pending output would overflow the screen, \ref backBuffer is extended
 *     by a new page to receive pending output.
 *
 *     Several conditions can prevent this step:  Step (2) was not executed,
 *     output is discarded on user request (\ref g_quitPrint = 1),
 *     \ref backFromCmdInput = 1 (\ref cmdInput needs the scrolling loop
 *     only).
 *
 *     Sets \ref printedLines to 0, indicating that nothing has been added to
 *     the new page yet. Increments \ref backBufferPos so all pending output is
 *     copied to the new page.  \ref g_pntrTempAllocStackTop may be reset to
 *     \ref g_pntrStartTempAllocStack.
 *
 * 4. The function parameters are used to create a new line.  Placeholders in
 *     \p fmt (see its description for details) are replaced with their
 *     respective data values, converted to text  All data is first stored in
 *     an internal buffer.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Output (if to screen) is discarded on
 *     user request (\ref g_quitPrint = 1 and \ref g_outputToString = 0),
 *     \ref backFromCmdInput = 1 (\ref cmdInput uses only the scrolling
 *     features)
 *
 * 5. Revert any \ref QUOTED_SPACE back to space characters in the string
 *     produced in step (4) (\ref printLongLine might have introduced these
 *     characters to prevent line breaks at certain space characters).  For
 *     this to work correctly, \ref QUOTED_SPACE must not be part of the
 *     regular output. (Doing so will trigger a bug check in
 *     \ref printLongLine .)
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Output (if to screen) is discarded on
 *     user request (\ref g_quitPrint = 1 and \ref g_outputToString = 0),
 *     \ref backFromCmdInput = 1 (\ref cmdInput uses only the scrolling
 *     features)
 *
 * 6. Perform line wrapping.  The wrapping is actually done in
 *     \ref printLongLine, which in turn calls this function to handle each
 *     broken down line separately.  The output generated in step (4) is copied
 *     onto \ref tempAllocStack, omitting a trailing LF.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: The output from step (4) (excluding a
 *     trailing LF) does not exceed \ref g_screenWidth, output is discarded on
 *     user request (\ref g_quitPrint = 1), output is redirected to a string
 *     (\ref g_outputToString = 1), \ref backFromCmdInput = 1
 *     (\ref cmdInput uses only the scrolling features)
 *
 *      __todo__ clarify variants/invariants
 *
 * 7. Print the prepared output onto the screen.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Step (6) (line wrapping) was executed,
 *     output is discarded on user request (\ref g_quitPrint = 1)
 *     output is redirected to a string (\ref g_outputToString = 1), a SUBMIT
 *     is silently executing (\ref g_commandFileSilentFlag = 1),
 *     \ref backFromCmdInput = 1 (\ref cmdInput uses only the scrolling
 *     features)
 *
 *     \ref printedLines is increased if the prepared output terminates with
 *     LF.
 *
 * 8. Add a new history page in \ref backBuffer for the output generated in
 *     step (4) if the current page has overflowed.  Do this even when scrolling
 *     is disabled.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Step (7) was not executed,
 *     \ref printedLines <= \ref g_screenHeight allows another line of output,
 *     the output printed in step (7) has no trailing LF and is appended to the
 *     last line of output, a SUBMIT is silently executing
 *     (\ref g_commandFileSilentFlag = 1), scrolling is enabled
 *     (\ref g_scrollMode = 1, step (c) handles this case).
 *
 *     \ref printedLines is set to 1.  \ref backBufferPos is increased.
 *     \ref g_pntrTempAllocStackTop may be reset to
 *     \ref g_pntrStartTempAllocStack.
 *
 * 9. Add the output to the \ref backBuffer.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Step (7) was not executed.
 *
 *     \ref g_tempAllocStackTop is reset to \ref g_startTempAllocStack.
 *
 * 10. Log the output to a file given by \ref g_logFilePtr.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Step (4) was not executed, a log file
 *     is not opened (\ref g_logFileOpenFlag = 0), output is redirected to a string
 *     (\ref g_outputToString = 1), \ref backFromCmdInput = 1 (\ref cmdInput
 *     uses only the scrolling features)
 *
 *     \ref g_tempAllocStackTop is reset to \ref g_startTempAllocStack.
 *
 * 11. Copy the prepared output in step (4) to \ref g_printString.
 *
 *     Some contexts prevent this step: Step (4) was not executed, output is
 *     not redirected to a string (\ref g_outputToString = 0),
 *     \ref backFromCmdInput = 1 (\ref cmdInput uses only the scrolling
 *     features)
 * .
 *
 * \param[in] fmt (not null) NUL-terminated text to display with embedded
 *   placeholders for insertion of data (which are converted into text if
 *   necessary) pointed to by the following parameters.  The format string uses
 *   the same syntax as
 *   <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf">[printf]</a>.  A LF
 *   character must only be in final position, and ETX (0x03) is not allowed.
 *   This parameter is ignored when \ref backFromCmdInput is 1.
 * \param[in] "..." The data these (possibly empty sequence of) pointers refer
 *   to are converted to string and then inserted at the respective placeholder
 *   position in \p fmt.  They should strictly match in number, type and order
 *   the placeholders.  The characters LF and ETX (0x03) must not be produced,
 *   with the exemption that an LF is possible if it appers at the end of the
 *   expanded text (see (a)).
 *   These parameters are ignored when \ref backFromCmdInput is 1.
 * \return \ref g_quitPrint 0: user has quit the printout.

 *     activates __step 2__ if not inhibited by other variables.

 * Submit each individual broken down line to \ref print2 for output.  All

 *
 * \p printLongLine pads a LF character to the right of \p line, if missing,
 * and honors embedded LF characters.  Still, each individual line
 * might need further breakdown to fit into the dimensions of the virtual
 * text display.  The maximal width available for a line is not limited by
 * \p g_screenWidth + 1 alone, leading or trailing prefix or suffix text also
 * reduce the available space.
 *
 * The following prefixes or suffixes are possible, and are applied to lines
 * too wide for the virtual text display, and, thus, they are presented in a
 * multi-line fashion.  We distinguish the first line, optional follow-up
 * lines, except for the last line being a special case.  They are visually
 * indicated in following ways:
 * - (a) leave the first line as is, start follow-up lines and the last line
 *      with a prefix \p startNextLine.
 * - (b) The same as (a) but right justify displayed text (the prefix
 *      \p startNextLine is still left aligned!) on virtual text display.  The
 *      fill character is a SP (0x20).
 * - (c) reserve the last column for a trailing ~ (0x7E) padded to the right of
 *      the first and every follow-up line, but not to the last one.
 *      The last and each follow-up line is indented by a space (SP, 0x20).
 *      The padded ~ follows the line immediately, the last column is a
 *      last resort and left blank in case of no need.
 * - (d) support for LaTeX: the same as (c), but instead of the ~ character a
 *      trailing % (0x25) is used.  The last and each follow-up line is indented
 *      by a space (SP, 0x20).
 *
 * The following list shows methods of breaking up a long line not containing a
 * LF character into first, follow-up and last screen lines.  Although the
 * methods aim at keeping each individual screen line within the limit given by
 * \ref g_screenWidth, some allow exceptions if for example an embedded link
 * address would be destroyed.  This supports HTML output, where the
 * virtual text display is not really important.  On the other hand, it likely
 * does not affect usual human readable text, because that has enough spaces
 * as break locations for even a small sized text display.
 *
 * 1. __Break at given characters__.  The \p breakMatch contains a non-empty
 *    set of characters marking optional break positions.  If a break occurs at
 *    such a point, the character is zapped, the substring before it becomes a
 *    screen line, the part after it is subject to further line breaking again.
 *    If not used as a break point, the character is left as is.
 *    The last character from \p breakMatch within the allowed line size
 *    determines the break position.  If there is none, the width of the
 *    virtual text display is temporarily suspended and increased as long by
 *    one, until the breaking algorithm finds a fit into the more and more
 *    widened text rectangle.  This temporary increase of dimensions affects
 *    the current screen line only.
 * 2. __Keep quotes__.  This mode is similar to 1., but text between two
 *    pairing quote characters " (0x22) is never split.  This mode allows
 *    breaks only at spaces (SP, 0x20) not contained in a quote.  For technical
 *    reasons the ETX (0x03) character must not appear in \p line.
 *    The parsing algorithm is kept simple, there is no way to use a " within a
 *    quote, it always delimits a quote.  Apart from these differences, all
 *    rules in 1. apply.
 * 3. __Break at any character__.  The \p line is broken into equally sized
 *    pieces, except for the first and last line.  The first one is not reduced by
 *    \p startNextLine, and may receive more characters than the following
 *    ones, the last simply takes the rest.  This method is not UTF-8 safe.
 * 4. __Compressed proof__.  This mode targets proof lines in Metamath that are
 *    encoded in a compressed style.  An example of a compressed proof is:
 *    \code{.unparsed}
 *    ( wa wn wo wi pm3.4 pm2.24 adantr pm2.21 jaoi pm2.27 imdistani orcd
 *    adantrr jca olcd adantrl pm2.61ian impbii ) ABDZAEZCDZFZABGZUCCGZDZUBUHUD

 *    UEUFUCUGDUDUBUCUGCUCCMNRSTUA $.
 *    \endcode
 *    Both the label section in braces and the following coded proof may exceed
 *    the virtual screen width as shown above, and need being broken down.
 *    The label section comprises of blank separated theorem names usually
 *    short enough to fit in a screen line.  The proof can be split at any
 *    position, except that the bounding __$=__ and __$.__ must be left intact.
 *    This method is not UTF-8 safe.
 *
 * \param[in] line (not null) NUL-terminated text to apply line wrapping to.
 *    If the text contains LF characters, line breaks are enforced at these
 *    positions.
 * \param[in] startNextLine (not null) NUL-terminated string to place before
 *   any follow-up and the last line.  If this prefix leaves not at least 4
 *   characters for regular output on a screen line (\ref g_screenWidth), it is
 *   truncated accordingly (not UTF-8 safe).
 *\n
 *   The following characters in first position trigger a special mode:\n
 *     ~ (0x7E) trailing ~ character, see (c). The rest of this parameter is
 *       ignored, a single space will be used as a prefix.
 * \param[in] breakMatch (not null) NUL-terminated list of characters at which
 *   the line can be broken.  If empty, a break is possible anywhere
 *   (method 3.).\n
 *   Special cases:
 *\n
 *   The following characters in first position allow line breaks at spaces (SP), but
 *   trigger in addition special modes:\n
 *     SOH (0x01) nested tree display (right justify continuation lines);\n
 *     " (0x22) activates method 3. (keep quotes).  For use in HTML code;\n
 *     \ (0x5C) trailing % character (LaTeX support), see (d);\n
 * \n
 *   An & (0x46) in first position activates method 4.  It should be followed
 *   by a SP (0x20) used to break down a list of theorem labels.  Besides
 *   activating method 4., an & in \p line also marks a potential break
 *   location, so this character must neither be used in label names, or
 *   in encoding compressed proofs.
 * \pre
 *   - method 4 requires the \p line containing a compressed proof to neither
 *     use an & or a multi-byte unicode character.
 *   - method 3 requires a \p line to not use a multi-byte UTF-8 character.

/*!
 * \brief requests a line of text from the \p stream.
 *
 * If not suppressed, displays a prompt text on the screen.  Then reads a
 * line from the \p stream.  Some lines are interpreted as described further
 * below, in which case the prompt is reprinted and the next line is read.
 * Returns the first not interpreted line as a \ref vstring.
 *
 * A line in the \p stream is terminated by a LF character (0x0D) character
 * alone.  It is read, but removed from the result.  The maximum line length
 * without the LF is \ref CMD_BUFFER_SIZE - 1.  Reaching EOF (end of file,
 * CTRL-D) is equivalent to reading LF, if at least 1 byte was read before.
 * Note that the NUL character can be part of the line.  Reading a NUL is not
 * sufficiently supported in the current implementation and may or may not
 * cause an error message or even undefined behavior.
 *
 * Reading from an empty \p stream (or one that is at EOF position, on the
 * console CTRL-D) returns NULL, not the empty string, and is formally
 * signalled as an error.  Overflowing the buffer is also an error.  No
 * truncated value is returned.
 *
 * This routine interprets some input without returning it to the caller under
 * following two conditions:
 *
 * 1. If scrolling is enabled, the input is interpreted.  A line consisting of
 * a single character b or B indicates the user wants to scroll back through
 * saved pages of output.  This is handled within this routine, as often as
 * requested and possible.
 *
 * 2. The user hits ENTER only while prompted in top level context.  The empty
 * line is not returned.
 *
 * No timeout is applied while waiting for user input from the console.
 *
 * A bug message need not result in an execution stop.  It is not directed to
 * the metamath bug function to avoid stacking up calls (bug calling cmdInput
 * again for scrolling etc.).
 *
 * \param[in] stream (not null) source to read the line from.  _stdin_ is
 *   common for user input from the console.
 * \param[in] ask prompt text displayed on the screen before \p stream is
 *   read.  This prompt is suppressed by either a NULL value, or setting
 *   \ref g_commandFileSilentFlag to 1.  This prompt must be not NULL (empty is
 *   fine!) outside of a SUBMIT call, where user is expected to enter input.
 *   \n
 *   It may be compared to \ref g_commandPrompt.  If both match, it is inferred
 *   the user is in top level command mode, where empty input is not returned
 *   to the caller.
 * \return a \ref vstring containing the first read and not interpreted line.
 *   NULL indicates an error condition.  The result needs to be deallocated by
 *   the caller, if not empty or NULL.
 * \pre
 *   The following variables are honored during execution and should be properly
 *   set:
 *   - \ref g_commandFileSilentFlag value 1 suppresses all prompts, not only
 *     those used for scrolling through long text.  It does not suppress error
 *     messages;
 *   - \ref g_commandFileNestingLevel a value > 0 indicates a SUBMIT call is
 *     executing, a read line is returned as is.  0 is seen as an interactive
 *     mode, where read lines can be interpreted;
 *   - \ref g_outputToString value 1 output is redirected and scrolling is
 *     disabled
 *   - \ref backBuffer may contain text to display on scroll back operations;
 *   - \ref g_scrollMode value 1 enables scrolling back through text held in
 *     \ref backBuffer;
 *   - \ref localScrollMode a value of 0 temporarily disables scrolling,
 *     overriding the setting in \ref g_scrollMode;
 *   - \ref g_commandPrompt if this string matches ask, top level user input is
 *     assumed, where empty lines are discarded.
 * \post
 *   \ref db is updated.
 * \warning the calling program must deallocate the returned string (if not
 *   null or empty).  Note that the result can be NULL.  This is outside of the
 *   usual behavior of a \ref vstring type.
 * \warning the returned string need not be valid ASCII or UTF-8.
 * \bug If a character read from \p stream is NUL, this may sometimes cause a
 *   print of an error message, but execution continues and in the wake may
 *   cause all kind of undefined behavior, like memory accesses beyond
 *   allocated buffers.

vstring cmdInput(FILE *stream, const char *ask);

/*!
 * \brief print prompt (or explanatory) text and then read a line.
 *
 * After a prompt text is printed, gets a line from either stdin or the
 * command file stream in \ref g_commandFilePtr, depending on the value of
 * \ref g_commandFileNestingLevel.  If this value is 0, interactive input via
 * stdin is assumed, else non interpreted lines are read from a file in submit
 * mode.  The line returned to the caller is more or less what \ref cmdInput()
 * yields, but some fine tuning is applied.
 *
 * \par Displaying the prompt text
 *
 * This function is prepared to display a longer text, before issuing a final
 * prompt line (unlike \ref cmdInput).  The text shown to the user is usually
 * wrapped around preferably at spaces to fit into a display of width
 * \ref g_screenWidth.  If possible, wrapping shortens the last line such that
 * space for 10 characters is left to the right for user input.
 *
 * \par Interactive Mode
 *
 * 1. A long prompt text may be interrupted for convenient page wise display.
 * The user's scroll commands are interpreted internally and not seen by the
 * caller.  If a line is either discarded or interpreted, the user is prompted
 * again. The full prompt text is never repeated, only its last line after
 * wrapping was applied.
 *
 * 2. Empty lines are discarded, and a reprompt is triggered.
 *
 * 3. A NULL resulting from an error (buffer overflow) or a premature EOF
 * (CTRL_D from keyboard) from \ref cmdInput is either returned as "EXIT".  Or
 * if the last line of the prompt starts with "Do", then it is assumed to
 * expand to "Do you want to EXIT anyway (Y, N)?" and a "Y" is returned. In any
 * case, the returned string is printed before it may finally trigger an
 * immediate stop on the caller's side.
 *
 * 4. If logging is enabled, prompt and returned input is logged.
 *
 * \par Submit Mode
 *
 * 1. a non-interpreted line is read from the appropriate entry in
 * \ref g_commandFilePtr by \ref cmdInput.
 *
 * 2. If NULL is returned, reaching EOF is assumed, the file is closed, its
 * name in \ref g_commandFileName deallocated and the previous
 * \ref g_commandFileNestingLevel is activated.  In this particular case the
 * read line is the empty string.  A message indicating the end of the command
 * file is printed.  The \ref g_commandFileSilentFlag controlling console
 * output is copied from the appropriate entry of \ref g_commandFileSilent,
 * unless the interactive mode is reached; here output is never suppressed
 * (value 0).
 *
 * 3. remove all CR (0x0D) characters, not only those in combination with LF.
 *
 * 4. prompt and command is printed, if not suppressed, then the read line is
 * returned.
 *
 * \return first not interpreted line as \ref vstring, or "EXIT" on error.
 * \pre
 *   The following variables are honored during execution and should be properly
 *   set:
 *   - \ref g_quitPrint a 1 suppresses wrapping and user controlled paging of
 *     the prompt text.
 *   - \ref g_commandFileSilentFlag value 1 suppresses output and prompts, but
 *     not all error messages;
 *   - \ref g_commandFileNestingLevel a value > 0 indicates a SUBMIT call is
 *     executing, where a read line is returned as is. 0 is seen as interactive
 *     mode, where read lines can be interpreted;
 *   - \ref g_outputToString value 1 renders scrolling as pointless and
 *     disables it;
 *   - \ref backBuffer may contain text to display on scroll back operations;
 *   - \ref g_scrollMode value 1 enables scrolling back through text held in
 *     \ref backBuffer;
 *   - \ref localScrollMode a value of 0 temporarily disables scrolling,
 *     overriding the setting in \ref g_scrollMode;
 *   - \ref g_commandPrompt if this string matches ask, top level user input is
 *     assumed, and an empty line is usually discarded;
 *   - \ref g_logFileOpenFlag if set to 1, a not interpreted returned line is
 *     logged before it is passed on to the caller.
 * \post
 *   - \ref localScrollMode is set to 1
 *   - \ref printedLines is reset to 0
 *   - \ref g_quitPrint is reset to 0
 *   - interactive mode: \ref tempAllocStack frees top elements down to
 *     \ref g_startTempAllocStack.
 *   - interactive mode: \ref pntrTempAllocStack frees top elements down to
 *     \ref g_pntrStartTempAllocStack.
 *   - interactive mode: The \ref backBuffer is cleared, then filled with
 *     prompt (last line only) and input of the user.
 *   - submit mode: In case of EOF the previous \ref g_commandFileNestingLevel
 *     is activated, necessary cleanups performed, and
