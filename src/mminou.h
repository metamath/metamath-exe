/*!
 * \brief requests a line of text from the __stream__.
 *
 * If not suppressed, displays a prompt text on the screen.  Then reads a
 * single line from the __stream__.  Returns this line as a \a vstring.
 *
 * A line in the __stream__ is terminated by a LF character (0x0D) character
 * alone.  It is read, but removed from the result.  The maximum line length
 * without the LF is \a CMD_BUFFER_SIZE - 1.  Reaching EOF (end of file) is
 * equivalent to reading LF, if at least 1 byte was read before.  Note that the
 * NUL character can be part of the line.  Reading a NUL is not sufficiently
 * handled in the current implementation and may or may not cause an error
 * message or even undefined behavior.
 *
 * Reading from an empty __stream__ (or one that is at EOF position) returns
 * NULL, not the empty string, and is formally signalled as an error.
 * Overflowing the buffer is also an error.  No truncated value is returned.
 *
 * This routine automatically handles input in a loop under following two
 * conditions:
 *
 * 1. If scrolling is enabled, the input is interpreted.  A line consisting of
 * a single character b or B indicates the user wants to scroll back through
 * saved pages of output.  This is handled within this routine, as often as
 * requested and possible.
 *
 * 2. The user repetitively hits ENTER (only) while prompted in top level
 * context.  The prompt is simply replayed as often.  Entering an isolated 'b'
 * or 'B' is first directed to case 1, and only if it cannot be served there, 
 * the routine exits, returning the b or B to the caller. 
 *
 * No timeout is applied when waiting for user input from the console.
 *
 * Detected format errors result in following bug messages:
 *   - 1507: The first read character is NUL
 *   - 1508: line overflow, the last character is not NUL
 *   - 1519: padding of LF failed, or first read character was NUL
 *   - 1521: a NUL in first and second position was read
 *   - 1523: no prompt text when user is required to input something
 *   - 1525: missing terminating LF, not caused by an EOF.
 *
 *   A bug message need not result in an execution stop.
 * \param[in] stream (not null) source to read the line from.  _stdin_ is
 *   common for user input from the console. 
 * \param[in] ask prompt text displayed on the screen before __stream__ is
 *   read.  This prompt is suppressed by either a NULL value, or setting 
 *   \a g_commandFileSilentFlag to 1.  This prompt must be not NULL (empty is
 *   fine!) outside of a SUBMIT call, where user is expected to enter input.
 *   \n
 *   It may be compared to \a g_commandPrompt.  If both match, it is inferred
 *   the user is in top level command mode, where empty input is not returned
 *   to the caller.
 * \return a \a vstring containing the read (or interpreted) line.  The result
 *   needs to be deallocated by the caller, if not empty or  NULL.
 * \pre
 *   The following variables are honored during execution and should be properly
 *   set:
 *   - \a commandFileSilentFlag value 1 suppresses prompts altogether, not only
 *     those used for scrolling through long text;
 *   - \a g_commandFileNestingLevel a value > 0 indicates a SUBMIT call is
 *     executing, where scrolling prompts are suppressed;
 *   - \a g_outputToString value 1 renders scrolling as pointless and disables it;
 *   - \a backBuffer may contain text to display on scroll back operations;
 *   - \a g_scrollMode value 1 enables scrolling back through text held in
 *     \a backBuffer;
 *   - \a localScrollMode a value of 0 temporarily disables scrolling, despite
 *     the setting in \a g_scrollMode;
 *   - \a g_commandPrompt if its string matches ask, empty input is ignored.
 * \post
 *   \a db is updated and includes the length of the interpreted input.
 *   Some input is ignored by simply reprinting the prompt:
 *   - Empty strings in top command level;
 *   - Isolated 'b' or 'B' input, if scroll mode is active, supported and the
 *     \a backBuffer provides a saved page.
 * \warning the calling program must deallocate the returned string (if not
 *   null or empty).  Note that the result can be NULL.  This is outside of the
 *   usual behavior of a \a vstring type.
 * \warning the returned string need not be valid ASCII or UTF-8.
 * \bug If the first character read from __stream__ is NUL (e.g. a file is
 *   read), this will cause a print of an error message, but execution
 *   continues and in the wake may cause all kind of undefined behavior, like
 *   memory accesses beyond allocated buffers.
