Variable-length string handler
------------------------------

     This collection of string-handling functions emulate most of the
string functions of VMS BASIC.  The objects manipulated by these
functions are strings of a special type called 'vstring' which have no
pre-defined upper length limit but are dynamically allocated and
deallocated as needed.  To use the vstring functions within a program,
all vstrings must be initially set to the null string when declared or
before first used, for example:

        vstring_def(string1);
        vstring stringArray[] = {"", "", ""};

        vstring bigArray[100][10]; /- Must be initialized before using -/
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
          for (j = 0; j < 10; j++)
            bigArray[i][j] = ""; /- Initialize -/


     After initialization, vstrings should be assigned with the 'let(&'
function only; for example the statements

        let(&string1, "abc");
        let(&string1, string2);
        let(&string1, left(string2, 3));

all assign the second argument to 'string1'.  The 'let(&' function must
_not_ be used to initialize a vstring the first time.

     Any local vstrings in a function must be deallocated before returning
from the function, otherwise there will be memory leakage and eventual
memory overflow.  To deallocate, assign the vstring to "" with 'free_vstring':

        void abc(void) {
          vstring_def(xyz);
          ...
          free_vstring(xyz);
        }

     The 'cat' function emulates the '+' concatenation operator in BASIC.
It has a variable number of arguments, and the last argument should always
be NULL.  For example,

        let(&string1,cat("abc","def",NULL));

assigns "abcdef" to 'string1'.  Warning: 0 will work instead of NULL on the
VAX but not on the Macintosh, so always use NULL.

     All other functions are generally used exactly like their BASIC
equivalents.  For example, the BASIC statement

        let string1$=left$("def",len(right$("xxx",2)))+"ghi"+string2$

is emulated in c as

        let(&string1,cat(left("def",len(right("xxx",2))),"ghi",string2,NULL));

Note that ANSI c does not allow "$" as part of an identifier
name, so the names in c have had the "$" suffix removed.

     The string arguments of the vstring functions may be either standard c
strings or vstrings (except that the first argument of the 'let(&' function
must be a vstring).  The standard c string functions may use vstrings or
vstring functions as their string arguments, as long as the vstring variable
itself (which is a char * pointer) is not modified and no attempt is made to
increase the length of a vstring.  Caution must be exercised when
assigning standard c string pointers to vstrings or the results of
vstring functions, as the memory space may be deallocated when the
'let(&' function is next executed.  For example,

        char *stdstr; /- A standard c string pointer -/
         ...
        stdstr=left("abc",2);

will assign "ab" to 'stdstr', but this assignment will be lost when the
next 'let(&' function is executed.  To be safe, use 'strcpy':

        char stdstr1[80]; /- A fixed length standard c string -/
         ...
        strcpy(stdstr1,left("abc",2));

Here, of course, the user must ensure that the string copied to 'stdstr1'
does not exceed 79 characters in length.

     The vstring functions allocate temporary memory whenever they are called.
This temporary memory is deallocated whenever a 'let(&' assignment is
made.  The user should be aware of this when using vstring functions
outside of 'let(&' assignments; for example

        for (i=0; i<10000; i++)
          print2("%s\n",left(string1,70));

will allocate another 70 bytes or so of memory each pass through the loop.
If necessary, 'freeTempAlloc' can be used periodically to clear
this temporary memory:

        for (i=0; i<10000; i++) {
          print2("%s\n",left(string1,70));
          freeTempAlloc();
        }

It should be noted that the 'linput' function assigns its target string
with 'let(&' and thus has the same effect as 'let(&'.

/* A vstring is allocated in temporary storage. These strings will be deallocated
  after the next call to `let`.

  A `temp_vstring` should never be used as the first argument of a `let`.
  This code is INCORRECT:

    temp_vstring foo = left("foobar", 3);
    let(&foo, "bar"); // this will cause a double free

  It is okay (and quite common) to use a temp_vstring as the second argument,
  however. It is best not to hold on to the value, though, because the `let`
  will free it. This code is INCORRECT:

    vstring_def(x);
    temp_vstring foobar = cat("foo", "bar");
    let(&x, foobar); // frees foobar
    let(&x, foobar); // dangling reference

  There is a converse problem when `temp_vstring`s are used without `let`:

    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
      vstring_def(x);
      if (strlen(space(i)) == 99999) break;
    }

  We don't need to deallocate the string returned by `space()` directly,
  because it returns a `temp_vstring`, but because there is no `let` in
  this function, we end up allocating a bunch of temporaries and
  effectively get a memory leak. (There is space for about 100
  temporaries so this loop will cause a crash.) To solve this problem,
  we can either use a dummy `let()` statement in the loop, or call
  `freeTempAlloc` directly:

    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
      vstring_def(x);
      if (strlen(space(i)) == 99999) break;
