/*! \page pgError "Simple Error Messaging"
 * When a fatal error occurs, the internal structures of a program may be 
 * corrupted to the point that recovery is impossible.  The program exits
 * immediately, but hopefully still displaying a diagnostic message.
 *
 * To display this final message, we restrict its code to very basic,
 * self-contained routines, independent on the rest of the program to the
 * extent possible, thus dodging corrupted data.
 *
 * In particular everything should be pre-allocated and initialized, so the
 * chance of a failure in a corrupted environment is minimized.  This is to the
 * detriment of flexibility, in particular, support for dynamic behavior is
 * limited.
 *
 * Often it is sensible to embed details in a diagnosis message.  Placeholders
 * in the format string mark insertion points for such values, much as in
 * \p printf. The variety and functionality is greatly reduced in our case,
 * though.  Only pieces of text can be embedded (%s placeholder).
 * 
 * Still, for this kind of expansion you need a buffer where the final message is
 * constructed.  In our context, this buffer is pre-allocated, and fixed in size,
 * truncation enforced.
