/*! \page pgError "Simple Error Messaging"
 * When a fatal error occurs, the internal structures of a program are usually 
 * corrupted.  It is therfore not safe to assume resources are still available.
 * Instead the program exits immediately after displaying some diagnostic
 * message.
 *
 * In order to display this final message, the program is restricted to very
 * basic self-contained routines, not dependent on any state of the program.
 * In particular everything should be pre-allocated and initialized, so the
 * chance of a failure is minimized, even if the program state is corrupted.
 * This goes at the expense of flexibility, in particular, support for dynamic
 * behavior is limited.  For example, the whole diagnostic message is fitted
 * into a buffer of a given size, truncation enforced.  Internal structures used
 * are isolated from the rest of the program.  The possible formats with
 * placeholders are restricted to those of %s type.
